The following environment variables have been configured in Vercel production:

#### SendGrid (Email Service)
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: [Configured in Vercel environment]
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: contact@yolovibecodebootcamp.com
- `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`: YOLOVibeCode

#### Square (Payment Processing)
**Production Credentials:**
- `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT`: production

- Access Token: EAAAl0nbPFFE7MyGeWGhcIh49DrsY0wVgPaR1LfXF-JCVN3LvKJWUm5Ez3UwZmND

## Authentication Status
- **Auth0**: ❌ Removed completely
- **Current Auth**: ✅ Custom database authentication using bcrypt and session tokens

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production with updated configuration
2. Test email sending with new SendGrid credentials
3. Test payment processing with Square production credentials
4. Monitor for any Auth0-related errors (there shouldn't be any)

## Important Notes
- The application now uses custom authentication instead of Auth0
- All Auth0 environment variables have been removed
- The health checker no longer checks Auth0 status
- Make sure to keep the Square production credentials secure
