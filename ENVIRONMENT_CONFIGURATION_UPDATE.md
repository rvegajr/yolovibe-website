- Removed Auth0 health checks from `src/infrastructure/health/HealthChecker.ts`
- Updated health dashboard to exclude Auth0
- Cleaned up test files

## Vercel Environment Variables Updated ✅

### Production Environment
The following environment variables have been configured in Vercel production:

#### SendGrid (Email Service)
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: [Configured in Vercel environment]
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: contact@yolovibecodebootcamp.com
- `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`: YOLOVibeCode

#### Square (Payment Processing)
Do not store live credentials in the repository. Configure these in your secret store or environment provider.
**Production Credentials (example placeholders):**
- `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT`: production
- `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: <redacted>
- App ID: <redacted>

**Sandbox Credentials (example placeholders):**
- App ID: <redacted>
- Access Token: <redacted>

## Authentication Status
- **Auth0**: ❌ Removed completely
- **Current Auth**: ✅ Custom database authentication using bcrypt and session tokens

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production with updated configuration
2. Test email sending with new SendGrid credentials
3. Test payment processing with Square production credentials
4. Monitor for any Auth0-related errors (there shouldn't be any)

## Important Notes
- The application now uses custom authentication instead of Auth0
- All Auth0 environment variables have been removed
- The health checker no longer checks Auth0 status
- Make sure to keep the Square production credentials secure
- Make sure to keep the Square production credentials secure
