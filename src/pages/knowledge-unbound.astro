          Here's the thing about teaching coding in 2025: keeping secrets is pointless. At <span class="knowledge-highlight">YOLOVibeCodeBootCamp</span>, 
          we figured out that the real magic isn't in some exclusive code library - it's in showing people how 
          to turn these tools into something meaningful in their own lives.

        <p class="dark:text-slate-100">
          This isn't some fluffy ideal - it's actually super practical. When more people know how to 
          use these new AI tools well, cool stuff happens faster. By opening everything up, we're not 
          shooting ourselves in the foot - we're building a bigger, better playground for everyone.

              These powerful AI tools aren't here to take your job - they're like power tools for your brain. 
              We'll show you how to use <span class="knowledge-highlight">agentic AI tools</span> to 10x your creativity and problem-solving, so 
              you stay ahead of the game instead of getting left behind.

              The old way of coding was all about fighting the machine to make it do what you wanted. 
              The new way is about finding the <span class="knowledge-highlight">right flow with AI</span> to build things 10x faster. We'll teach 
              you to stop treating the computer as the enemy and instead find your vibe with these tools.

            <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
              We're cool with you sharing pretty much everything from our workshops. Seriously. 
              <span class="knowledge-highlight">Teach your friends, put it on YouTube</span>, whatever. This knowledge wants to spread. 
              (Just don't, like, share login credentials or anything dumb like that.)

            "AI isn't just replacing jobs. It's forcing us to <span class="knowledge-highlight glow-text">rethink what makes humans valuable</span> in the first place."

        </div>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
          Let's talk about what everyone's thinking but not saying out loud: AI is going to displace a lot of jobs, 
          and will likely disproportionately benefit the wealthy and shareholders. This isn't some far-future concern - 
          it's happening right now. This financial displacement will affect those whose jobs are taken much more severely.
        </p>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
          In the absence of a dividend system where wealthy corporations help provide resources to those affected, 
          the best we can do is help people learn AI as effectively as possible. This is why we cannot hoard this knowledge 
          or use it solely for monetary gain - we must <span class="knowledge-highlight">freely share it with everyone</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
          People who understand how to work with powerful agentic AI tools won't just survive - they'll thrive. 
          Our workshops aren't about teaching you coding tricks that will be obsolete in 6 months. They're about giving 
          you the mindset and approach to keep evolving alongside these powerful tools.
        </p>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
          When people are empowered with knowledge and "aroused" by the superpowers AI can give them and their ideas, 
          these ideas provide value for everyone around them. It creates a net effect of benefiting the most people when 
          we freely share knowledge rather than restricting it for profit.
        </p>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
          It may seem hypocritical that we charge for these workshops, but we present the material in such a way that 
          you can go home and teach your kids, parents, and friends the core concepts. And they can teach their friends. 
          We want all of us to discuss what we've learned and build things we never thought possible - not just to make money, 
          but to realize that we are instruments in a symphony of what AI is about to help us create.
