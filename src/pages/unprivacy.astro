        <p>
          Traditional privacy policies and copyright restrictions are walls to keep people out. That's not our style. At YOLOVibeCodeBootCamp, 
          we're breaking down barriers with radical openness - because when more people have access to powerful tools 
          and knowledge, we all benefit. We don't just have a minimal privacy policy - we have NO privacy policy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We believe technology should empower everyone, not just a privileged few. As AI reshapes our economy and job market, 
          the answer isn't to hoard knowledge but to share it widely, helping people discover new forms of value and 
          creativity within themselves.

        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">Here's what we're all about:</p>
        
        <ul class="space-y-4">

            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-cyan-500 w-8 h-8 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold mr-3 flex-shrink-0 mt-1">3</span>

            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 dark:text-white">Stuff We Need From You</h2>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">We keep it simple - just the basics:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 dark:text-slate-200">
          <li>Your name and email so we know who's coming to our workshops</li>
          <li>Payment details (Stripe handles this, not us)</li>
          <li>Anonymous site visit info to see what's working</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 dark:text-white">What We Do With It</h2>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">Pretty straightforward stuff:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 dark:text-slate-200">
          <li>Send you workshop confirmation and prep materials</li>
          <li>Let you know about new workshops (but not spam you)</li>
          <li>Improve our materials based on what people find most helpful</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 dark:text-white">Security (The Boring But Important Bit)</h2>
        
        <p class="dark:text-slate-200">
          We take the basic security steps you'd expect - SSL encryption, decent passwords, 
          that kind of thing. We're not storing state secrets here, but we're not careless either.
          However, in the spirit of radical transparency, we want to be clear: we prioritize openness over privacy.
