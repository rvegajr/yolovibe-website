# 🛡️ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT SAFETY GUIDE 🛡️

## 🎯 **GUARANTEED PRODUCTION DATA & MONITORING**

This guide ensures you **NEVER** deploy with mock data and **ALWAYS** know if your system is working correctly.

---

## 🚨 **MANDATORY PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECK**

**ALWAYS** run this before deploying:

```bash
npx tsx src/registration/cli/pre-deployment-check.ts
```

This script will:
- ✅ Verify all database tables exist
- ✅ Confirm real data is present (not mocks)
- ✅ Check all critical services
- ✅ Validate environment configuration
- ❌ **BLOCK deployment if anything is wrong**

**If this script fails, DO NOT DEPLOY!**

---

## 📊 **REAL-TIME MONITORING**

### Dashboard Monitoring
Your admin dashboard now includes real-time production health:
- 🟢 **Data Source Status**: Shows if using real database or fallbacks
- 🟢 **Service Health**: All critical services monitored
- 🟢 **Alert System**: Immediate warnings for any issues

### Access Monitoring
Visit: `https://your-domain.com/admin/dashboard`

The dashboard shows:
```json
{
  "productionHealth": {
    "overall": "HEALTHY",
    "dataSource": "REAL_DATABASE",
    "isUsingRealData": true,
    "services": [...],
    "alerts": [...]
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### Before Every Deployment:

1. **Run Safety Check**
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/registration/cli/pre-deployment-check.ts
   ```
   ✅ Must exit with code 0 (success)

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required for production:
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
   SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_square_id
   
   # Production indicators:
   NODE_ENV=production
   VERCEL=1  # (if using Vercel)
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - ✅ All tables created from `schema.sql`
   - ✅ Reminder tables from `reminder-schema.sql`
   - ✅ At least 2 active products
   - ✅ Database connection working

4. **Service Configuration**
   - ✅ Email service (SendGrid) configured
   - ✅ Payment service (Square) configured
   - ✅ All API endpoints responding

### After Deployment:

1. **Immediate Health Check**
   - Visit `/admin/dashboard`
   - Verify "Data Source: REAL_DATABASE"
   - Check all services show "HEALTHY"

2. **Test Critical Flows**
   - Workshop booking works
   - Email notifications send
   - Payment processing works
   - Reminder system active

---

## 🚨 **PRODUCTION ALERTS**

### Automatic Monitoring
The system continuously monitors:
- Database connectivity
- Service health
- Data validation
- API response times

### Alert Conditions
You'll be alerted if:
- ❌ System falls back to mock data
- ❌ Database becomes unreachable
- ❌ Email service fails
- ❌ Payment service fails
- ❌ API endpoints return errors

### Alert Channels
Configure alerts in production:
- Dashboard warnings (immediate)
- Console logs (for debugging)
- External monitoring (add Slack/email/PagerDuty)

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### Safe Deployment Process:

```bash
# 1. Run safety check (MANDATORY)
npx tsx src/registration/cli/pre-deployment-check.ts

# 2. If check passes, deploy
vercel --prod  # or your deployment command

# 3. Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.com/admin/dashboard
```

### Emergency Health Check:
```bash
# Check system health anytime
npx tsx src/registration/cli/pre-deployment-check.ts
```

### Reminder System Status:
```bash
# Test reminder system
npx tsx src/registration/cli/demo-reminder-system.ts
```

---

## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### "Database tables don't exist"
```bash
# Apply main schema
sqlite3 your-database.db < src/registration/database/schema.sql

# Apply reminder schema
sqlite3 your-database.db < src/registration/database/reminder-schema.sql
```

### "Using fallback data"
- Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Verify database connection
- Ensure tables have real data (not empty)

### "Email service down"
- Check SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable
- Verify SendGrid account status
- Test email sending manually

### "Payment service degraded"
- Check SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID environment variable
- Verify Square account configuration

## 📈 **MONITORING BEST PRACTICES**

1. **Check Dashboard Daily**
   - Verify "REAL_DATABASE" status
   - Monitor service health
   - Review any alerts

2. **Set Up External Monitoring**
   - Add uptime monitoring (Pingdom, etc.)
   - Configure Slack/email alerts
   - Monitor key metrics

3. **Regular Health Checks**
   - Run pre-deployment check weekly
   - Test critical user flows monthly
   - Review system logs regularly

---
